-   make a "coming soon" banner to show what movies are coming

-   add option to see full list of showtimes (like how the times are displayed in the email)

-   make media query mixins for multiple screen sizes

-   keep organizing the JS (keep splitting into seperate files)

-   make the synopsis content hidden and click to expand it?

-   add a fade in animation for cards every time a day tab is clicked on

-   make the day tabs into a slider with overflow hidden so I can add next weeks showtimes when they become available?
